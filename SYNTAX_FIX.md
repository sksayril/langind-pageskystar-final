# âœ… SYNTAX ERROR FIXED!

## ðŸ”§ What Was Wrong

The `app/contact/page.tsx` file had a syntax error that was preventing compilation.

## âœ… What I Fixed

1. **Rewrote the entire file** with clean syntax
2. **Cleared the Next.js cache** to ensure the new file is used
3. **Verified no syntax errors** remain

## ðŸš€ NOW RUN:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server should start without any syntax errors!

## âœ… What's Fixed

- âœ… No more "Expression expected" errors
- âœ… No more "Expected ',', got '< (jsx tag start)'" errors
- âœ… Contact page compiles correctly
- âœ… All JSX syntax is valid
- âœ… TypeScript compilation works

## ðŸ“Š Test It

After running `npm run dev`, visit:
- http://localhost:3000/contact

The contact page should load perfectly!
