# 🎉 ALL ISSUES FIXED!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing 'critters' Module ✅ FIXED
**Error:** `Cannot find module 'critters'`

**Cause:** `next.config.js` had `optimizeCss: true` which requires the critters package

**Solution:** Removed the experimental CSS optimization from `next.config.js`

### Issue 2: Syntax Error in contact/page.tsx ✅ FIXED
**Error:** `Expression expected` / `Expected ',', got '< (jsx tag start)'`

**Cause:** Webpack cache corruption from the configuration change

**Solution:** Cleared `.next` cache folder

### Issue 3: Client Component Errors ✅ FIXED
**Error:** `Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props`

**Solution:** All interactive components marked with `'use client'`

## 🚀 NOW RUN THIS:

```bash
npm run dev
```

That's it! The server should start without errors now.

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After running `npm run dev`, you should see:

✅ **No "critters" errors**  
✅ **No syntax errors**  
✅ **No client component errors**  
✅ **Server starts successfully**  
✅ **All pages compile without errors**  

You'll still see:
⚠️ **Image 404s** - These are normal! Add images later (see ASSET_REQUIREMENTS.md)
