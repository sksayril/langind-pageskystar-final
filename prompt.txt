Project: Skystar Solution — Premium dark-mode digital marketing agency landing page & portfolio

Goal: Create a high-converting, ultra-premium dark-mode website (landing + multi-page site) for "Skystar Solution". Visual language: luxurious, minimal, neon-glow accents, glassmorphism panels, soft motion, precise typography, lots of negative space. Prioritize readability, modern micro-interactions, and strong visual hierarchy.

Deliverables:
- Landing / Home (hero, services, case studies, process, testimonials, pricing, CTA)
- About (founder/CEO story, team bios, values)
- Services (SEO, Paid Ads, Social Media, Content, Creative Studio, Web Dev)
- Blog (SEO-optimized posts, categories: SEO, Digital Marketing, AIO, LMO, Case Studies)
- Contact / Request a Quote (form + calendar link)
- Separate components: Header/Nav, Footer, Hero, ServiceCard, CaseStudyCard, PricingCard, BlogCard, AuthorCard, ContactForm, Modal demo, Floating CTA, Cookie/consent
- Accessibility: keyboard focus states, high contrast text, reduced motion alternative

Visual specs:
- Palette: #0b0f16 (bg), deep charcoal gradients, accent neon gradient (electric cyan -> magenta -> gold) used sparingly for glow and CTAs
- Primary font: modern sans (Inter / Poppins); headings heavy weight with letter-spacing
- Buttons: glass button + subtle neon outer glow; primary CTA filled with neon gradient and soft blur/golden rim
- Effects: subtle parallax hero, soft shadows, frosted glass panels, hover glow, micro-interactions on links, smooth 60fps transitions (transform + opacity only)
- Cursor: custom glowing cursor with trailing particles and magnet effect when hovering CTAs (see cursor snippet)
- Mode: default dark only; include toggle for high-contrast mode
- Performance: critical CSS, lazy load images, optimized LCP, Next.js image component

Copy tone: confident, professional, slightly playful; short benefit-first headlines, strong social proof.

SEO & content:
- Meta tags for each page, OpenGraph images (preview with neon logo), structured data for Organization, BlogPosting for each post
- Blog content should be SEO-optimized with H1/H2/H3 structure, keyword variations, internal links to services
- Provide 5 starter SEO articles (outline + meta) including “What is AIO?”, “What is LMO?” and an SEO-optimized case study

Deliver production-ready component list and Next.js + Tailwind starting scaffold, plus a developer handoff with assets, tokens, and interactions.
