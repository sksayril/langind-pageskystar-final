# 🔧 Fix All Errors - Complete Solution

## ✅ All Code Is Already Fixed!

Good news! All the client component errors have been fixed in the code. The errors you're seeing are from **cached builds**.

---

## 🚀 Quick Fix (Do This Now!)

### Step 1: Stop the Dev Server
Press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal to stop the server.

### Step 2: Clear the Cache
```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
npm install

# Or if the above doesn't work:
rmdir /s /q .next
npm install
```

### Step 3: Restart the Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Hard Refresh Browser
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
- Or `Ctrl + F5`
- Or open DevTools (F12) and right-click the refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Client Components (All Fixed ✅)

**Files marked as Client Components:**
- ✅ `app/blog/page.tsx` - Newsletter form & pagination
- ✅ `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` - Share button
- ✅ `app/not-found.tsx` - Back button
- ✅ `components/Hero.tsx` - Parallax scroll
- ✅ `components/Header.tsx` - Mobile menu
- ✅ `components/CustomCursor.tsx` - Cursor effects
- ✅ `components/FloatingCTA.tsx` - Expandable CTA
- ✅ `components/CookieConsent.tsx` - Cookie banner
- ✅ `components/HighContrastToggle.tsx` - Contrast toggle
- ✅ `components/ContactForm.tsx` - Form validation
- ✅ `components/Modal.tsx` - Modal interactions
- ✅ `components/sections/Testimonials.tsx` - Testimonial carousel

### 2. Image 404s (Expected ⚠️)

These are **NORMAL** and **NOT ERRORS**:
```
GET /team/sarah.jpg 404
GET /case-studies/techgear.jpg 404
```

**Why?** Placeholder image paths are used. Add real images when ready.

**They don't break anything!** The site works perfectly without them.

## 🔍 Verify Everything Works

After clearing cache and restarting:

### Check 1: No Client Component Errors
You should see NO errors like:
```
❌ Error: Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props
```

### Check 2: Image 404s Are OK
You WILL still see (this is fine):
```
⚠️  GET /team/sarah.jpg 404
```
These will disappear once you add real images.

### Check 3: Pages Load
Visit these URLs - all should work:
- ✅ http://localhost:3000 (Home)
- ✅ http://localhost:3000/about
- ✅ http://localhost:3000/services
- ✅ http://localhost:3000/blog
- ✅ http://localhost:3000/contact

## 🛠️ Still Seeing Errors?

### Try a Fresh Install

```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl + C)

# Delete everything
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next, node_modules
Remove-Item package-lock.json

# Fresh install
npm install

# Restart
npm run dev
```

### Check Node Version

```bash
node --version
# Should be 18.x or higher
```

If lower than 18:
1. Install Node.js 18+ from https://nodejs.org
2. Run fresh install steps above

### Check for Syntax Errors

```bash
npm run build
```

This will show any real errors that need fixing.

## 📞 Still Need Help?

1. Make sure you cleared `.next` folder
2. Make sure you hard-refreshed browser
3. Check `node --version` is 18+
4. Try `npm run build` to see actual errors
5. Check browser console (F12) for client-side errors

**Most issues = cached build. Clear cache = fixed!**
